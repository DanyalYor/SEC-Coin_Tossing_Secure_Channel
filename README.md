# Introduction
The way I have chosen to implement this assignment is simply by simulating a network and communication between Alice and Bob over the network. It is demonstrated in a 3rd person view in the console, where each step is explained and you get to see the outputs as well.  
   
# How to run the program
I have chosen to implement my solution in python and thus the way to run the program would simply be to open the folder in a terminal and type in    
`python main.py`  
OR     
`python3 main.py`   
You then simply just need to press space through each step in the simulation :)
